                        <span>Feats</span> In 2022 recorded a major hit with SODA LUV - KARINA
                        In my opinion this is a very big push forward from now on the artist will be 
                        able to do collaborations with other artists.
                        <br><br> 
                        This album is best known for the track “НИЧЕГО ЛИЧНОГО 2” 
                        and for good reason. Few songs have been ahead of their 
                        time quite like this one. Other highlights include “Ghosttown” 
                        featuring Travi$ Scott from the days where he still sported a 
                        dollar sign in his name, and “Monster”

                        <span>NO COMMERCIAL LYRICS</span> is another project on the shorter side, 
                        in which Heroin worked closely with producer Wex & Lawzy
                        to create a gloomy spectacle that evokes images of a 
                        ravaged Gleba walking through desolate paths and 
                        post-apocalyptic landscapes. 
                        <br><br>
                        There is certainly a 
                        unique melancholy flavor that is consistent in this 
                        album and displays the growing maturity of Gleb as an 
                        artist. The mixtape is consistently gorgeous and feels really revolutionary. 
                        A few personal favorites include the tracks “ В миноре ” and “ PROJECT X”.
